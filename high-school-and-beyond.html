            <p>Start of high school is the exciting time to start exploring the different professions, looking for that one that "calls from your heart" - Auntie Kim's words seemed to be coming back over and over, every time Tea was looking at that Thanksgiving Day photo...</p>
<p>Tea is a grade 8 student in an Ontario school. Like many other students at this age, she is smart, curious, taking lots of effort trying to fit into the school life around her and bracing herself for high school starting next year. She hasn't decided yet what she is planning to do after school. The conversation had come up previously with her parents, but it had never been something that would occupy her mind for long. With all the exciting social events, the volunteering nights and extracurricular activities that were filling Tea's days, she hardly ever had the moment to stop to think...</p>
<p>This wonderful Thanksgiving day, Tea had spent the day helping her grandma prepare for the big family gathering. She had the honour and responsibility of decorating the house and the dining table all by herself, for the first time, and she was surely feeling thankful for being trusted with something that meant so much for her Grandma... this was going to be a wonderful day, Tea was excited that she'll get to see her older cousins and especially looking forward to meet Auntie Kim again, who had just returned from her two year study trip from Italy...</p>
<p>Tea got into conversation with her aunt Kim about this and that, and conversation turned to the future plans.</p>
<p>- There are so many possibilities, so hard to choose what to do, - says Tea with a bit of despair.</p>
<p>- Yes, Kim agrees, - sometimes it's hard to know what to aim for. One way is to talk to your school counselor; they are really good at helping you uncover your interests that you may not have noticed yourself. There are also specialized tests that you can take that tell you in what profession would feel the most productive.</p>
<p>- Oh, we discussed something like that last year, and even took a small test. I did not realize it was for choosing a profession...</p>
<p>- Choosing 2-3 career paths for yourself can really help you narrow down your efforts. Fortunately here in Ontario, once you have a general idea in which area you want to be, there are high school programs that can get you there faster.</p>
<p>Kim tried to draw on a napkin some of the options for Tea.</p>
<p><img alt="AP IB Coop SHSM OYAP " height="50%" src="https://www.yourstudyguide.ca/img/001/scribblings.png" width="50%"></p>
<p>- Perhaps they seem like funny abbreviation, they are programs that help you to prepare better for your chosen profession or help you deeper explore your interests.</p>
<p>- What is AP,  Kim? -  asked Tea. - Is this something about news making?</p>
<p>- Not exactly, dear. This is a special program that can help you study certain subjects with little more depth. Let's say you would like to continue with science major. If you take AP courses in math, you will be able to learn near the level of the first year of the university. It may require a bit more effort, but the best part is that many universities will give you credit for your effort, as so you won't have to complete those classes again.
There is also a program called Dual Credit, with this you can get involved in really interesting courses with colleges such as working with video editing, marketing, psychology or even flight attendant. You also get credits for these courses if you would like to continue studying them in the college.</p>
<p>- What about IB? I think I read it on one of the schools posters - it said International Baccalaureate - I like the sound of it, reminds me of the vacation we did couple summers ago in Europe.</p>
<p>- You are rather on point, Tea. This is a program for you if you consider continuing education in other countries. Once you get an IB diploma, it makes you stand out when you apply at University or college outside of Canada. In Canada it is somewhat similar to AP,  but it's broader in terms of subjects you are going to study, whereas in AP you get to choose what exactly you want to specialize in.</p>
<p>- I remember talking about Coop programs with my friends, was it like working while in school?</p>
<p>- Let's see. There are couple different types of co-op programs. I think this might be actually a good idea for you to consider, especially if you enjoy hands on experience. There are several options to choose from - SHSM (which stands for Specialist High Skills Major) is a program where you get opportunities to work at an office, attend a trade show, tour an art gallery or volunteer at a professional sports team event and get feel if you are comfortable in those environments. OYAP (short for Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program) - is also another good option, if you would like to have a profession before deciding on a college. Say you want to be an electrician, chef or motorcycle technician then this program is for you to get a head start towards the certification.</p>
<p>- Wow, this was a lot of information to think about, Kim. I think we need to go get some more coffee with cookies now, to get this all settled down in my head...</p>
